# Pointers

## What is a pointer even supposed to be

Stupid question you might say. Not that much, actually. Pointers are a pretty unique concept. From the CPU's point of view, pointers are just random numbers, like `int`s (that's why you can easily convert between the two). However, they have a completely different meaning from a programmer's point of view. See memory as an array of bytes (8 bit numbers) and pointers as a very special type of index designed for that array. TODO
