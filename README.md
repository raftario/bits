An (hopefully) beginner friendly guide to various low level programming concepts

## Introduction

Writing low level code isn't much harder than writing high level code. However, bad low level code is easier to write and good low level code is harder to write, especially for people who are just starting programming. I feel like this might be due to the small amount of beginner friendly resources to get into it compared to higher level stuff. I also feel like it's a good thing to start with low level programming, because of the better understanding and riguor it results in. Looks like there's a possible gap to fill, and I'm relatively confident in my ability to fill it, so here we go.

This guide is separated in sections treating different subjects, in no particular order. Each section contains numbered modules, meant to be read in order, starting with some (hopefully) light theory and ending with practical examples going through the concepts, with code samples in C++. The code is inlined by small chunk to provide a better reading experience, but the full samples are available as separate files. If prior knoweledge of a topic not covered in the current section is required, it will be specified.

This guide also assumes at least _some_ knoweledge of programming and of C++. This is an introduction to low level concepts, so variables, conditionals, loops and other basic concepts are left to introductions to programming.

## Sections

-   [Pointers and dynamic memory](pointers-and-dynamic-memory/00-manual-memory-management.md) covers manual memory management and everything that it implies.

Want to add something to a section, or a whole new section ? Think something could be improved in an existing one ? Go for it, as long as it follows the rest. This is the kind of project where more stuff is always better. Also don't hesitate to open an issue or a PR if you spot anything wrong, may it be written content or a code sample.
